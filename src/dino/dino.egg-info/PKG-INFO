              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Pretrained models
You can choose to download only the weights of the pretrained backbone used for downstream tasks, or the full checkpoint which contains backbone and projection head weights for both student and teacher networks. We also provide the backbone in `onnx` format, as well as detailed arguments and training/evaluation logs. Note that `DeiT-S` and `ViT-S` names refer exactly to the same architecture.

## Training

### Documentation
Please install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and download the [ImageNet](https://imagenet.stanford.edu/) dataset. This codebase has been developed with python version 3.6, PyTorch version 1.7.1, CUDA 11.0 and torchvision 0.8.2. The exact arguments to reproduce the models presented in our paper can be found in the `args` column of the [pretrained models section](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino#pretrained-models). For a glimpse at the full documentation of DINO training please run:
```
python main_dino.py --help
```

### Vanilla DINO training :sauropod:
Run DINO with ViT-small network on a single node with 8 GPUs for 100 epochs with the following command. Training time is 1.75 day and the resulting checkpoint should reach 69.3% on k-NN eval and 74.0% on linear eval. We provide [training](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/example_runs_logs/dino_vanilla_deitsmall16_log.txt) and [linear evaluation](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/example_runs_logs/dino_vanilla_deitsmall16_eval.txt) logs (with batch size 256 at evaluation time) for this run to help reproducibility.
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 main_dino.py --arch vit_small --data_path /path/to/imagenet/train --output_dir /path/to/saving_dir
```

### Multi-node training
We use Slurm and [submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit) (`pip install submitit`). To train on 2 nodes with 8 GPUs each (total 16 GPUs):
```
python run_with_submitit.py --nodes 2 --ngpus 8 --arch vit_small --data_path /path/to/imagenet/train --output_dir /path/to/saving_dir
```

<details>
<summary>
DINO with ViT-base network.
</summary>

```
python run_with_submitit.py --nodes 2 --ngpus 8 --use_volta32 --arch vit_base  --data_path /path/to/imagenet/train --output_dir /path/to/saving_dir
```

</details>

### Boosting DINO performance :t-rex:
You can improve the performance of the vanilla run by:
- training for more epochs: `--epochs 300`,
- increasing the teacher temperature: `--teacher_temp 0.07 --warmup_teacher_temp_epochs 30`.
- removing last layer normalization (only safe with `--arch vit_small`): `--norm_last_layer false`,

<details>
<summary>
Full command.
</summary>

```
python run_with_submitit.py --arch vit_small --epochs 300 --teacher_temp 0.07 --warmup_teacher_temp_epochs 30 --norm_last_layer false --data_path /path/to/imagenet/train --output_dir /path/to/saving_dir
```

</details>

The resulting pretrained model should reach 73.3% on k-NN eval and 76.0% on linear eval. Training time is 2.6 days with 16 GPUs. We provide [training](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/example_runs_logs/dino_boost_deitsmall16_log.txt) and [linear evaluation](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/example_runs_logs/dino_boost_deitsmall16_eval.txt) logs (with batch size 256 at evaluation time) for this run to help reproducibility.

### ResNet-50 and other convnets trainings
This code also works for training DINO on convolutional networks, like ResNet-50 for example. We highly recommend to adapt some optimization arguments in this case. For example following is a command to train DINO on ResNet-50 on a single node with 8 GPUs for 100 epochs. We provide [training logs](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/example_runs_logs/dino_rn50_log.txt) and [final checkpoint](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/example_runs_logs/dino_rn50_checkpoint.pth) for this run.
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 main_dino.py --arch resnet50 --optimizer sgd --lr 0.03 --weight_decay 1e-4 --weight_decay_end 1e-4 --global_crops_scale 0.14 1 --local_crops_scale 0.05 0.14 --data_path /path/to/imagenet/train --output_dir /path/to/saving_dir
```

## Self-attention visualization
You can look at the self-attention of the [CLS] token on the different heads of the last layer by running:
```
python visualize_attention.py
```

<div align="center">
  <img width="100%" alt="Self-attention from a Vision Transformer with 8x8 patches trained with DINO" src=".github/attention_maps.png">
</div>

## Self-attention video generation
You can generate videos like the one on the blog post with `video_generation.py`.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46140458/116817761-47885e80-ab68-11eb-9975-d61d5a919e13.mp4

Extract frames from input video and generate attention video:
```
python video_generation.py  --pretrained_weights dino_deitsmall8_pretrain.pth \
    --input_path input/video.mp4 \
    --output_path output/ \
    --fps 25
```

Use folder of frames already extracted and generate attention video:
```
python video_generation.py  --pretrained_weights dino_deitsmall8_pretrain.pth \
    --input_path output/frames/ \
    --output_path output/ \
    --resize 256 \
```

Only generate video from folder of attention maps images:
```
python video_generation.py --input_path output/attention \
    --output_path output/ \
    --video_only \
    --video_format avi
```


## Evaluation: k-NN classification on ImageNet
To evaluate a simple k-NN classifier with a single GPU on a pre-trained model, run:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 eval_knn.py --data_path /path/to/imagenet
```
If you choose not to specify `--pretrained_weights`, then DINO reference weights are used by default. If you want instead to evaluate checkpoints from a run of your own, you can run for example:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 eval_knn.py --pretrained_weights /path/to/checkpoint.pth --checkpoint_key teacher --data_path /path/to/imagenet 
```

## Evaluation: Linear classification on ImageNet
To train a supervised linear classifier on frozen weights on a single node with 8 gpus, run:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 eval_linear.py --data_path /path/to/imagenet
```

We release the logs and weights from evaluating the different models:

## Evaluation: DAVIS 2017 Video object segmentation
Please verify that you're using pytorch version 1.7.1 since we are not able to reproduce the results with most recent pytorch 1.8.1 at the moment.

**Step 1: Prepare DAVIS 2017 data**  
```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/davisvideochallenge/davis-2017 && cd davis-2017
./data/get_davis.sh
```

**Step 2: Video object segmentation**  
```
python eval_video_segmentation.py --data_path $HOME/davis-2017/DAVIS/ --output_dir /path/to/saving_dir
```

**Step 3: Evaluate the obtained segmentation**  
```
git clone https://github.com/davisvideochallenge/davis2017-evaluation $HOME/davis2017-evaluation
python $HOME/davis2017-evaluation/evaluation_method.py --task semi-supervised --results_path /path/to/saving_dir --davis_path $HOME/davis-2017/DAVIS/
```

## Evaluation: Image Retrieval on revisited Oxford and Paris
Step 1: Prepare revisited Oxford and Paris by following [this repo](https://github.com/filipradenovic/revisitop).

Step 2: Image retrieval (if you do not specify weights with `--pretrained_weights` then by default [DINO weights pretrained on Google Landmark v2 dataset](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dino/dino_vitsmall16_googlelandmark_pretrain/dino_vitsmall16_googlelandmark_pretrain.pth) will be used).

Paris:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --use_env --nproc_per_node=1 eval_image_retrieval.py --imsize 512 --multiscale 1 --data_path /path/to/revisited_paris_oxford/ --dataset rparis6k
```

Oxford:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --use_env --nproc_per_node=1 eval_image_retrieval.py --imsize 224 --multiscale 0 --data_path /path/to/revisited_paris_oxford/ --dataset roxford5k
```

## Evaluation: Copy detection on Copydays
Step 1: Prepare [Copydays dataset](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/~jegou/data.php#copydays).

Step 2 (opt): Prepare a set of image distractors and a set of images on which to learn the whitening operator.
In our paper, we use 10k random images from YFCC100M as distractors and 20k random images from YFCC100M (different from the distractors) for computing the whitening operation.

Step 3: Run copy detection:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --use_env --nproc_per_node=1 eval_copy_detection.py --data_path /path/to/copydays/ --whitening_path /path/to/whitening_data/ --distractors_path /path/to/distractors/
```
We report result on the strong subset. For example in the stdout from the command above we get: `eval on strong mAP=0.858`.
